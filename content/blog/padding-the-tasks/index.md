    A place to keep track of yours tasks! This was done using Go for the backend. This was a fun project to tackle because I took an example I really liked, and converted the backend from a different language, I think it was NodeJS, to use Go for the backend. This was challenging, but overall a fun problem to overcome and grow my skillset.
