    In this project at the IntraEdge internship, we made a mini-project within the span of two days to get some MVP out that the entire group would end up working on.
  </h3>
  <p>
    There was no designated Frontend/Backend team. This was to make up for time lost learning on the frontend part during the Learntube project. We have a feautured user on the home page that changes every hour. There is a random user that you can look at by clicking on the random user button.
